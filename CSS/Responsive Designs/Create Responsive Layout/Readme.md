Create Responsive Layout

Now that we have talked a lot about responsive layouts, its time for you to design one
You need to make 3 divs with width of '32%' and height of '300px' and margin 0.4%. Their colors are - '#ff8989', '#88f7ce', '#e29df2' respectively.
On screens above 600px they should appear next to each other .
otherwise they should be stacked as shown in images below.

Originally, the page will look like this on a desktop's browser - https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001734.png

Then after the browser width decreases below 600px, the page looks like - https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001733.png
