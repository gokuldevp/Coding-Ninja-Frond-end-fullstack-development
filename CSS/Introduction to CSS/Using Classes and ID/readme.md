Using Classes and ID
Send Feedback
As you can see that we have 2 header elements defined in our blog and we only wanted to add the padding to the header of our blog and not of our article.
The solution to this problem is using the classes and id attributes.
Giving the classes and id's to certain elements give us the ability to manage and deal with different fragments of code differently.
First, try this yourself and also modify the CSS file accordingly.
Rewrite the styles (wherever necessary) using the class and id on the elements from the list given below -


Inside Header
1. We want to differentiate the 2 headers present, so give id 'main-header' to the 1st header in the blog.
2. Give the p tag - <p>Coding Ninjas Official Blog</p>, id 'about-site' and apply 'grey' color to it.
3. Give the parent element of the last image of the header an id 'header-image-container'.


Inside Main
1. Give the header id 'blog-header'
2. Give the article an id 'blog-content'.
3. Give the div containing the image, id 'blog-image-container'.
4. Give the headings inside the article, class 'h-style' and apply 'darkslategrey' color to it.
