Moving Styles to External File

Wow! making a new CSS file for the styles really means cleaner code, less redundancy and easy debugging.
Let's do the same for our page as well.
You can now see a CSS editor as well. You need to move the styles to this editor.
Note: You are not required to add link to this editor here in the question. It is taken care of internally. But do remember to create a link when using your own editor(sublime or some other).
Remember to remove the styles tag from the elements in your blog.
Also, add 'darkslategrey' color to the title of the blog.
