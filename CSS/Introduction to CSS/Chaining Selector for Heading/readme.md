Chaining Selector for Heading

Now we will see how we can use chaining selectors.
Suppose we need to apply a style to the different headings of our page, so it's logical to use the same class name for all the headings.
So, add class "h-style" to the remaining headers of the blog page.
Now, apply different font family to these headings using the class only.


Below are the basic font styles to be added -
ELEMENT                 FONT FAMILY
 <h1>                    sans-serif
 <h4>                    monospace
Also, increase the text size of all the <h4> tags to 18 pixels.


Expected look of the blog page is - https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001551.png
