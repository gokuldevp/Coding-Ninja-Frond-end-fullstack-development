Add Social Icons: Complete Resume Header

You now know about fontawesome, where you can pick icons instead of images, since they load fast and take less space than images.
So, it's not a good idea to use images everytime, therefore, change those images to icons.


Start by adding the below link to your head section within script tag -
href="https://kit.fontawesome.com/b3348ae33f.js" crossorigin="anonymous


Note: The link mentioned above may vary according to the version update.

Now, go to this link - https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery and search for the icons over there and add them to your resume, like below -
<i class="fa-brands fa-linkedin"></i>



The shadow used on the social icons is of the color - 'rgba(230,196,196,0.3)'.


The header section of the resume will look like this - https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001637.png
