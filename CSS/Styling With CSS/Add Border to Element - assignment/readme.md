Add Border to Element

Borders are a great way to show a part differently from others and create a great visual effect as well.
Look at the expected look of the page and create a border on 'main' element of '5px' with color '#ff6060'.
See that there is no border on the left side of the blog and 50px roundness is provided to the borders.
