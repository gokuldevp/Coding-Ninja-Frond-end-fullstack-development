Set Image Size

Relative units are very important to get some responsiveness to a page.
Whereas, absolute units define that the size remains the same no matter the screen size.
The blog created does not have proper images size.

So just set the proper size for the images according to the instructions provided below-
TASK 1: Set the width of the image globally to 100%. This will make all the images width equal to the width of its parent.
TASK 2: Set an id to the parent of the first image( i.e. 'coding-ninjas-logo.png') to "logo" and set the absolute width of the image to 210px.
TASK 3: Change the width of the blog content from '1000px' to '90%' of the viewport width.
TASK 4: Change the size of the text of element with id 'site-title' to '1.8rem'.
