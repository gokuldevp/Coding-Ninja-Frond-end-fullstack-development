Add Margin and Padding to Blog

Margin and padding are used to provide space between content and content, and content and border, respectively.
Both of them share a similar syntax, but the functionality is very different. You will see how they will arrange the content of the blog efficiently.

Below are some of the tasks you have to perform -
1. To the body tag, set left margin to 60 pixels and right margin to 20 pixels.
2. Set the top margin of the main header to 60 pixels.
3. Remove the bottom margin of the element with id 'site-title'.
4. Set the top margin of header image container to 50 pixels.
