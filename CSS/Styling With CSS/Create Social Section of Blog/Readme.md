Create Social Section of Blog

We will now connect our blog with some of the social links.
The HTML code is already been written inside the HTML file. You just need to write the CSS code for it. You will not be able to see the icons at first, since they are white in color.
Although in the expected look of the blog, the social divs appears to be positioned at the specific location in the blog. But actually, they are positioned 'fixed'.


Background colors for the social divs are provided below-
