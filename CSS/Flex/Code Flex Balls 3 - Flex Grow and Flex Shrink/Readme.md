Code: Flex Balls 3
Send Feedback
Remember the box has shrunk all of a sudden and we were not able to stack all balls together ! So now we have replaced some of those rigid balls with new ones which are flexible and can shrink or expand when needed.
The first ball is rigid so we can't compress it, but the next three will be compressed equally and the last two will be compressed twice more than the others. So write code to achieve the same - https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001667.png

Oops! a terrible thing has happened. The last two balls have bursted. Now all the balls except first one are are flexible so they will expand to fill up the remaining space. Ball 4 being most flexible will expand 3 times that of ball 2 and ball 3 will expand twice more than second ball - https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001666.png
