Fibonnaci Series

Create a 'fibonacciSeries' function that takes a number N as a parameter and checks if it is a member of the Fibonacci series or not.
Return true if the number is a member of the Fibonacci series, else return false.
Fibonacci Series is defined by the recurrence
  F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
where F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1
Sample Input :
finbonacciSeries(5)
Sample Output :
true
