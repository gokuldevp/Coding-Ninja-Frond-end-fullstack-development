Timer

Create a simple counter function, which when called will return two functions: start() and stop(). Use those functions to start the counter and stop them. The start() function should start printing 0 â€¦. N - 1 with one second delay between every logs. The stop() should pause the counter. Use setTimeout() and Promises to do this.
