Counter

You might have seen a timer on some web sites or at least on your phone. We are also going to create a wonderful timer ourselves.
The counter starts from zero and ends at some number which the user enters in the input. The input only takes a number.
We will create a small counter, for now, that can only go from one to nine. Handle all the possible cases when the 'Start Counter' button can be clicked.
Increase the counter after 1 Sec.
Note: Use the innerHTML property to set and get the counter values.
