Auto Fill Skill Bars

Let's add a dynamic feature in your resume using JavaScript.
Have you ever seen some animation or something that only happens when you reach that part of the web page?
We will be doing something similar in our resume as well. In the skills section, we have made several skills that have different smaller colored bars inside them.
When you reach that section of skills, it should trigger a loading animation in all of the skills. This means that the initial width of these colored bars is zero. Then as soon the section is reached, the colored bars increases their width slowly until they reaches their desired length.
